/*
The purpose of this function is to read data over the serial bus from the FPGA, package it's, save it to file, and transmit it to the GCS. The wifi address of both the OBC (the computer this code runs on) and the GCS is to be assigned by SpaceX during the competition. The IP address of the OBC will be configured by a user using ifconfig, and the user will edit a file labeled OBC_IO.cfg that contains the GCS computer's IP address. 

The first step simply uses the ifconfig system call to read its own wifi IP address and reads the GCS wifi IP address from the OBC_IO.cfg file. If this is blank, it can run the main loop and record FPGA data,  but must wait until both of these are filled with data before it can transmit data to the GCS. (Maybe it should ping the GCS, and if it cannot will simply log in a file that GCS connection is lost. Similarly, if it is not receiving any FPGA data, it will do nothing. The task of sending notifications of FPGA loss to the GCS and safe-stop if GCS link loss should be handled by other functions.)

Assuming it knows it's own and the GCS's IP address, and has link it will transmit data along with saving. 

FPGA data coming in on the serial bus will have a header followed by data. For our first bit of code, we are using the IMU data that is structured like so (I think):

#YPR=-155.73,-76.48,-129.51
Accel x,y,z=-2.00,3.00,294.00

What we will do is use a class to sort these into an array. Let's look at the gyro data first (#YPR). What we want to do is create a class with a data buffer and a time buffer. We want the buffer to fill up to 1.5kB of data before transmitting to the GCS. However, we don't want to wait too long before transmitting any particular piece of data. So there will be a time buffer to ensure that data of the same type is transmitted at least 10 times per second. Once we put this data into this array, we transmit it once the buffer is filled or the time requirement has been met, whichever is first, and also save it to a file. 

What we want to do is open a file, name it with something that identifies it (so YPG), followed by a time stamp, which will be the time stamp of when the first bit of data was detected. So for this example, it will create a file called "YPR1445672229.dat". We don't want the file to get too large. It's really arbitrary, but we don't want to have to deal with too large of files, so let's close the file once it reaches 100MB in size and open a new one. The code should time stamp each line that it reads as it comes in. So, if you were to open YPR1445672229.dat it would look like this:

1445672229.00001, -155.73,-76.48,-129.51
1445672229.00002, -155.43,-75.43,-127.32
1445672229.00003, -155.73,-76.48,-129.51
...

This represents what it would look like on the day file and on the data stream being sent to the GCS. 

This is how it will work with all data types.
